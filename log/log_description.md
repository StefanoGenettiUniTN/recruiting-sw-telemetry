The purpose of this directory is to store the log files generated by the computational process.

Each session has a unique identifier like: `1664611291_592`

For each session there are two files:

- raw data file (`1664611291_592`): in these files there are stored the data recived while in the Run state

- csv statistics (`1664611291_592_statistics.csv`): each raw data file has its corresponding .csv file. Here there are stored the statistics of the session (e.g. the number of messages with a given ID recived during the session). These latter are generated when the finite state machine changes state from Run to Idle.
